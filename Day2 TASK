1.Write a blog on the difference between document & window object?
Answer: 
i) Window: *) Window object is a browser environment which run only within the browser. 
           *) We can access window by window only.
           *) Global object,function,variables of javascript are members of window.
           *) Properties of the window are not accessed by document object.
           *) Window is the part of BOM (Browser object Model) not DOM.
        
ii) Document: *) Document object is loaded inside the window.
              *) All HTML tags are part of document object.
              *) Document is the part of both BOM and DOM.
              *) we can access the document by window.document
              *) Document properties also can be accessed by windows.document.property_name.
